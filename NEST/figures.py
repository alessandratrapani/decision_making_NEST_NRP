#TODO coint toss inuts --> mean and time integration 
#TODO comparison NEST/Brian COIN TOSS: raster+activity+decision space
#TODO n=1000 trials who's winning?+Delta S computation --> as figure3C

#TODO coin toss with 0 variability in the inputs

#TODO network performance and error trials Fig4a
#TODO evaluate the network time courses at: 3.2%, 6.4%,12.8%, 25.6% Fig4b (n trials=1000 and take the mean)

#TODO compare 0.0% and 51.2% --> time that it take to cross the 15Hz threshold (figure 5a-b) --> need to find a linear relationship between mean reaction time and log coherence level

#TODO test stimulus duration fig6A

#TODO test persistent activity --> decrease recurrent exc weights -> again 0 12.8 51.2
# da notare: no ramping, no winner takes all a 0.0, no persistent activity.

#TODO testare NMDA slow reverberation --> switch off?

#TODO reverse decision --> possibilità di cambiare quando avviene lo stimolo reverse (Percentage choices for A and B as function of the onset time of reversal.Fig8A Even when the signal is reversed 1 s after the stimulus onset, the decision is still re- versable by a more powerful input.
