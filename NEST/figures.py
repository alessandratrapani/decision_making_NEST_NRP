#TODO 1 comparison NEST/Brian at 0%, 12.8%, 51.2% raster and activity (Hz)

#TODO 2 coint toss inuts --> mean and time integration 
#TODO 3 comparison NEST/Brian COIN TOSS: raster+activity+decision space
#TODO 4 n=1000 trials who's winning?+Delta S computation --> as figure3C

#TODO 5 coin toss with 0 variability in the inputs

#TODO 6 network performance and error trials Fig4a
#TODO 7 evaluate the network time courses at: 3.2%, 6.4%,12.8%, 25.6% Fig4b (n trials=1000 and take the mean)

#TODO 8 compare 0.0% and 51.2% --> time that it take to cross the 15Hz threshold (figure 5a-b) --> need to find a linear relationship between mean reaction time and log coherence level

#TODO 9 test stimulus duration fig6A

#TODO 10 test persistent activity --> decrease recurrent exc weights -> again 0 12.8 51.2
# da notare: no ramping, no winner takes all a 0.0, no persistent activity.

#TODO 11 testare NMDA slow reverberation --> switch off?

#TODO 12 reverse decision --> possibilità di cambiare quando avviene lo stimolo reverse (Percentage choices for A and B as function of the onset time of reversal.Fig8A Even when the signal is reversed 1 s after the stimulus onset, the decision is still re- versable by a more powerful input. Percent- age choices for A and B as function of the coherence level of the reversed signalFig8B
